Today, I had a thought that keeping track of my progress on this app would be useful/helpful for a variety of reasons. I begin this log on 7.11.2019 though I have already made much progress.

-- Researched and integrated .gitignore to hide config file (sensitive info). Took longer than it should have. Made a mistake that I caught later. I uploaded the config file, then overwrote (overwrit?) it by updating the repository. While researching online, I happened to read a line on a website which advised to re-shuffle the api/access keys whenever you accidentally upload a config file because it will continue to exist on previous versions of the app. So, all keys were updated so that (to my knowledge) they remain a secret.
-- O-Auth. This step has so far consumed many hours of reading and trying to understand what needs to be done. There are many layers to authentication which I am happy exist as a a consumer but tear me down as a developer. Read as much as could from Twitter's authentication page to wrap my head around this idea. I ended up finding a python library from the 'requests' module website which handles o-auth1 incredibly elegangtly. I was prepared to manually code each step to retrieve authentication. Before, I was getting many 400 responses; after using the OAuth1 module from requests_oauthlib, I received a 200 response on the first try (the greatest thing). However, I learned a lot about http requests from the process before encountering the OAuth1 library. The masochist in me wanted to try out manual authentication to see if I could. There is still much work to be done in terms of completing the 3-pronged authentication process described on Twitter and actual implementation on the app.

-- Encryption methods established
-- Attempted to establish the "Sign in with Twitter" button on the template. Button is deployed but needs styling revisions
-- Dove into Flask documentation, mainly to learn about session handling. Still need to establish method for storing access keys during authorization
